# Smart-Factories---Predicting-Future-Failure-of-Machine

This module offers the potential to optimize maintenance tasks in real time, maximizing the useful life of their equipment and avoiding disruption to operations.
Responsibilities:
1. Built machine learning model which predicts machine failure.
2. Created an API which will take real time data from IoT sensors and will internally call the machine learning model.
3. Built the dashboard which accepts real time data from IoT sensors and showcase the machine status.
Technologies used:
Python, HTML, CSS, Web API and Flask
